1. Plot a probability density function for Gaussian Distribution
2. Create a sample of random Gaussian numbers with mean 50 and standard deviation 5. Plot the distribution.
3. Plot a sample of Gaussian random numbers.
4. Plot histogram of random Gaussian numbers with bins size 50. Also, plot the sample by varying the bin size and write the observation.
5. Calculate mean
6. For the random gaussian distribution plotted in Q.2 find quartiles and five-number summary.
7. Consider the hypothesis " The sample is drawn from Gaussian Distribution". Report the test statistics on the hypothesis using the following normality test methods.
Shapiro-Wilk test
D'Agostino's K squared Test
Anderson-Darling Test
